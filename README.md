This project was a Masters dissertation completed with 6 months of Java knowledge in August 2013 and has not been changed since (November 2014).  It is an ambulance application that connects with a server to receive new jobs, sends from the server to the phone patient and drug information stored in a database, uses the Google API to draw map directions, and has a messaging system for communication between phone and hospital.

The Google Maps feature will require a new Google API token setup.  The JUnit tests have been lost to time.

The project received a distinction and led to a PHD offer, but coding improvements are embarrassingly easy to spot with 15 months more experience.  At some point in future I may improve upon this.
